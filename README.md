# Hospital-Time-Reduction
The inefficient scheduling of appointments at ABC Hospital in California, USA, has led to excessive patient wait times, surpassing the industry benchmark, unlike competitors who maintain an average wait time of 30 minutes.
Patient dissatisfaction: Extended wait times can frustrate patients, adversely affecting their experience and loyalty, potentially leading them to seek care elsewhere.
•
Underutilized resources: Unfilled slots, idle staff, and inefficient use of examination rooms represent wasted resources and lost revenue opportunities.
•
Financial losses: Missed revenue from unfilled appointments and additional costs associated with rescheduling further erode the financial performance.
Objective:
Implementing the Lean Six Sigma methodology allows for a systematic analysis and improvement of the appointment scheduling process. This can result in:
•
Reduction in patient wait times: Improves scheduling accuracy and efficiency, bringing it closer to the industry benchmark of 30 minutes
•
Increment in patient satisfaction: Streamlines appointment booking and reduces wait times to enhance patient experience and loyalty
•
Optimization of resource utilization: Uses staff and examination rooms efficiently to maximize resources and minimize waste
•
Increment in revenue: Reduces missed appointments and improves scheduling processes to contribute to improved financial performance
End goals:
•
Analyze the appointment scheduling process and identify the root cause of lengthy wait times
•
Reduce wait time to 30 minutes and optimize resource utilization to increase patient satisfaction and boost revenue
•
Increase patient satisfaction by 15%
